# odin-recipes

This is my attempt at the first project in the HTML section of the Foundation course on The Odin Project. 

Upon completion:
Not sure how much I learnt anew, as I have done some FreeCodeCamp in the past, but I found myself blasting through the third recipe having
solidified my memory of the basic html boilerplate and functionality without needing to refer to the learning material. A day later and 
the things I'd have previously struggled to remember are still there in memory. All in all, looking forward to learning how to add more styles-
super excited to get to JavaScript, I know I'm going to have to work against rushing myself.

Having returned after completing the first CSS section, 
I've learned a lot, and enjoyed applying it to this page. 
The css is a mess, and I am forever recognising that there
is a much better way to do things. To group, or organise selectors more efficiently.
Whenever I attempt to fix these issues however, I get sidetracked 
by other possibilities, and end up reading about something 
ToP has not yet covered, but the freedom it offers with its assignments is especally enjoyable.

I think this page has become a method of procrastination in and of itself, and unless guided return to this page,
I will not be altering this further, so that I may continue with The Odin Project.  

For anyone who, as unlikely as may be, ended up here - There are multiple CSS aspects and at-least one entire class that does nothing.
[As far as i can tell]
For us Newbs it is not immediately obvious. Do not learn from me.
