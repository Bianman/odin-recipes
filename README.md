# odin-recipes

This is my attempt at the first project in the HTML section of the Foundation course on The Odin Project. 

Upon completion:
Not sure how much I learnt anew, as I have done some FreeCodeCamp in the past, but I found myself blasting through the third recipe having
solidified my memory of the basic html boilerplate and functionality without needing to refer to the learning material. A day later and 
the things I'd have previously struggled to remember are still there in memory. All in all, looking forward to learning how to add more styles-
super excited to get to JavaScript, I know I'm going to have to work against rushing myself.
