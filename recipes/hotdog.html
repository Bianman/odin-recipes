            alt="Two rather dry hotdogs entirely without condiments placed rather lovelessly into two equally moistless buns, sat atop a wooden chopping board for some reason. They are flanked by three similarly desert-like hotdogs that someone forgot to buy buns for, and in the foreground, there's a touch of foliage that fell off of a nearby tree. The tree is not pictured."
